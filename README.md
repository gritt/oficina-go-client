# oficina-go-client

When I worked at [@thoughtworks](https://github.com/thoughtworks), [@ramalho](https://github.com/ramalho) promoted a hands-on Golang course to [@globo.com](https://github.com/globocom) folks, and I gave some talks as a special guest.

In this talk I've briefly covered Go Modules.

This is the client app, and [this is the dependency pkg](https://github.com/gritt/oficina-go-pkg).
